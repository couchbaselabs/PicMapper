## PicMapper

Reads EXIF data from your Camera Roll and adds thumbnails to Couchbase Lite for display in MapKit.

## To Run

Drop [CouchbaseLite.framework](http://www.couchbase.com/download#cb-mobile) into the root of your checkout. Open the project in Xcode 6. Build and run.

## Read the Code

All the action is in `PicMapper/AppDelegate.swift` and `PicMapper/ViewController.swift`.

## Demo App

This app was put together for [FOSS4G 2014](https://2014.foss4g.org/session/implementing-basic-geocouch-support-couchbase-lite/) and so it's a good place to look at code for working with EXIF, MapKit, and Couchbase Lite in Swift. But it's missing a lot of niceties, so feel free to file bugs.
